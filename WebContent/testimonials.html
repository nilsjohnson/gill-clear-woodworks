                    Cedar Bench
                </h3>
                <p>
                    "I had Sam French @Gill CC Woodworks build me an outdoor bench out of Eastern Red Cedar from Gill, MA. Now that we live on Martha's Vineyard, I was looking for a functional piece of art I could use on display outside of our home to show off a little of where we are from, a place in nature in the Pioneer Valley in Western MA, to connect to the island life we live now. The perfect piece was this bench. Custom made from design to delivery, Sam worked with me over the phone to make this a birthday present to remember for my wife, Anna. I see us growing old together on this bench, and the craftsmanship and sustainable materials used make me believe the bench (and it's maker) will be a hallmark for some time to come. Thanks Sam!" -Nate Davies, West Tisbury MA

                    "Overall, the subtle beauty of this table promotes the joy of work. I feel as though treated to a special occasion when meeting with others at this table. The polished blonde tabletop collects sunlight and illuminates the room with warm tones. Natural irregularities and gentle curves in the cherry wood invite creativity during meetings and writing sessions. The effect is at once both soothing and a multiplier of productivity." - VentureWell, Hadley MA

                    Dining Table and Matching Bench
                </h3>
                <p>
                    Sam French is an exceedingly skilled and detail-oriented craftsman. The entire process of working with him was a pleasure, and we learned much along the way. Sam invited us to his workshop and wood warehouse (in Gill, MA) one Friday afternoon, a defunct dairy farm, where he gave us a grand tour and tutorial of the variety of wood we could choose from. Because we had not yet moved to our new place, we were concerned that creating the right style out of thin air, to complement an ultra contemporary space, left the potential for any number of problems. But, throughout the process, Sam communicated with us the steps he was taking, including our thoughts and suggestions in the design of what became our live-edge cedar top, cherry trestle-based dining table and matching bench. It felt like a collaborative endeavor. Sam promptly responded to our ideas, going so far as to update us regularly with photographs at each stage of his process. We enjoy having our friends and family over for dinner parties, and they often compliment the singularity of Sam’s craftsmanship. We expect this piece to be in our home for decades, and we’re very much looking forward to working with Sam again: this time, a mail table and bar stools.
                    <p>Warm regards,</p>
